## Audio on the Web

Before HTML5, audio files could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash).

The HTML5 <audio> element specifies a standard way to embed audio in a web page.

## The HTML <audio> Element

To play an audio file in HTML, use the <audio> element:

# example
```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```

## HTML Audio - How It Works
The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.
